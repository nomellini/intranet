These are my main objectives for the 0.1.x releases.
Once this list becomes blank it will be released as 1.0.0,
which I will consider to be the first "stable" release.

Other major changes will be introduced as I move into 1.1.x,
which will be the next set of development releases.


TODO in 0.1.x:
o Code cleanup!
o Any bug fixes
o Cosmetics improvements on the error messages in admin

TODO in 1.1.x:
o Easy customization of most text messages (language modules)
o Possibly a comment system?
