FOR USERS OF SYMPOLL 0.1.97 OR LATER:
You must replace ALL of the old files with the new ones
for complete functionality.  That is all.

FOR USERS OF SYMPOLL 0.1.96 OR EARILER:

You must replace ALL of the old files with the new ones
for complete functionality.

Also, you will need to add a table to your database.  The new 
table is used to store administration account information.
The declaration for this table has been included in the file
upgrade.mysql.  It can be merged into your Sympoll database
by issuing the following command in your shell.  Remember to
replace <user> with your MySQL user name.  Keep in mind that 
this may be different than your login for the operating system.
Also replace <sympdb> with the Sympoll database name, which
would be `sympoll` if you followed the README file exactly.  
You may have had to use a different database name though.  
Finally, this assumes you are in the same directory as the 
upgrade.mysql file:

mysql -u<user> -p <sympdb> < upgrade.mysql

Alright, now that we've finished that you're almost done.  The
last step is to browse to your admin.php3 file (or whatever
you may have renamed it to) so that you can set up your admin 
account.  Simply click the Authenticate button without entering
anything in the text fields.  Sympoll will detect that an admin
account does not exist and it will prompt you to create one. 
Once this account is created you can log in using it.  Note that 
once you create your admin account, clicking the authenticate
button will generate an Invalid Login error unless the correct 
login information is specified.

One last thing.  For consistancy in the code, please replace
display_boothUI with display_booth in any places that you
embedded a poll.  The first will still work for backwards
compatibility, but it will be removed in a future version.


Note 1)
Remember, once you've added the new database table, the FIRST
person to attempt to log in gets to create the admin account.
Be sure that it is you!  =P

Note 2)
I recommend reviewing the notes at the bottom of the README file for
other important information.
