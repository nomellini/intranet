[> 15-NOVEMBER-2000 -- v0.1.99
- Ugh, missed an is_numeric() call in polllist.php3.  That has
  been replace with a PHP3-happy expression. (thx james)
- Fixed a parse error where some versions of PHP did not like
  having stuff like ${$this} with the brackets, so all instances
  were changed to $$this.  (thx james)
- Fixed potential problem where "logout" did not force the 
  authentication cookie to expire on some browsers.  It should
  work much better now.  Also _hopefully_ fixed problem with
  invalid logins when using correct information.
- Fixed potential problem with using spaces or commas in your
  admin user name.  They should work now.
- If specified $urlpath does not end in a slash, one is added.
+ Inline results now have the total number of votes displayed at
  the bottom.

[> 13-NOVEMBER-2000 -- v0.1.98
- booth.php3 now just passes a pid to dovote.php3 instead of a
  serialized poll object.  dovote.php3 then uses this pid to
  create the poll again.  it now involves a little more overhead,
  but it shouldn't make a noticieable different.  The change is 
  because versions of Apache before 1.3.2 or so could not handle 
  the previous method.
- A comment in config.php3 said that the urlpath variable does not 
  need an ending slash.  It should have said that it DOES need the 
  slash.
- Removed a call to "is_numeric" because it is not supported
  in PHP3.
- Fixed problem with authentication cookie timing out very quickly. 
+ Added logout option in the admin sector, which should invalidate
  your authentication cookie.

[> 07-NOVEMBER-2000 -- v0.1.97.1
- Fixed problem with PHP3 not being able to find functions in the
  admin.php3 file (PHP4 did not have this problem).
- Rearranged the way passwords were handled a little, hopefully
  fixing an incompatibility.

[> 05-NOVEMBER-2000 -- v0.1.97
+ Results table is now displayed instead of the voting booth if the 
  visitor has already on that particular poll.  This is done via
  cookies.  If the user is not accepting cookies, they will instead
  be forwarded to the full-page results after voting, and will just
  see the regular booth in the page during subsequent visits.
+ Added the ability to display a random activated poll and also the
  ability to display the newest activated poll (will display the
  poll with the most current timestamp, without any updating on your
  part).  This is in addition to the previous ability to display
  a specific poll.  See README for implementation details.
+ Added authentication to administration page.  Code originally
  contributed by Robert "Longwalker" Brim  (Please see README)
+ Added several code snippets to support the authentication stuff.
  This includes option to change your password and detection to
  add a new admin account if none exists.  At the moment only one
  admin account may exist.  Multiple accounts with different 
  levels of permission will be added in a future version.
+ Added ability to view a poll under the adminstration page.  As
  of right now it does not include statistics-- It simply displays
  the question, options, and code snippet needed to embed the chosen
  poll.  Will add statistic-related information in a future release.
- Sympoll usually attempts to detect the URL path of its directory.
  Under certain web server configurations, it was not getting the
  correct URL.  There is now an option in includes/config.php3 to
  override the value it detects.
- Fixed "reset" and "delete" not working in admin (thx aaron rogers)
- Fixed minor bug where the number of option fields given when 
  editing a poll was one less than specified in the config file.
* Adjusted bars in images/ directory so that they look at least 
  somewhat decent when scaled horizontally OR vertically.
* Code for admin page reorganized and somewhat improved.
* Many other minor code tweaks

[> 03-SEPTEMBER-2000 -- v0.1.96
- Fixed a bug that caused the entire script to not work under 
  PHP 4.0.2.  PHP 4.0.1 and eariler would tolerate it, but 4.0.2
  would not.
* Slightly changed the format of the poll list page.  It's now using
  one less layer of tables to format, so hopefully that should help
  some of the smaller browsers with correct rendering.

[> 04-AUGUST-2000 -- v0.1.95.2
- Fixed a problem where I was declaring variables GLOBAL when they
  should not have been.  PHP4 didn't seem to mind, but PHP3 would
  print out a warning message and continue. (thx chi)

[> 03-AUGUST-2000 -- v0.1.95.1
- Ack!  sympoll.mysql for some reason did not make it into v0.1.95. 
  It is added here.  That file addition is the only change.
  (thx roger/cwchan)

[> 01-AUGUST-2000 -- v0.1.95
* README modified to reflect changes.
* Moved config.php3 to includes/
* Renamed polls.php3 to polllist.php3
* Sympoll now has some object-oriented PHP in it.  This should hopefully
  reduce database calls a little, and makes the code look cleaner to me.  =)
* On admin page, if no polls currently exist, the only option to select will
  be "create".
+ Added HTML header and footer support.  see includes/header.php3 and
  includes/footer.php3.  Currently these are utilized on the results
  page and the list of polls.
+ Added the ability to view results without voting.  This can be done by either
  clicking on "Vote!" without selecting an option, or by clicking the "Results"
  link in the booth.
- Fixed some formatting (cosmetic) that looked weird when long options or 
  questions were used.  May have some more work to do here at some point.
- When cookies are on and a person tries to vote a 2nd time, they will be
  forwarded to the results (with a note that says they already voted once).  
  Previously, they would go to a blank page that told them they already voted.
- Fixed potential problem with HTML not liking "quotation marks" when entering
  questions or options.
- Fixed(?) a strange problem that sometimes caused a url to be missing a slash.
- Fixed some minor bugs that didn't seem to cause any problems.

[> 06-APRIL-2000 -- v0.1.3.1
* moved blank.gif to images/
* added a _teeny_ bit of security:  admin.php3 can now be named to 
  anything.php3.  it is recommended that you do NOT leave it as admin.php3, 
  and still rename it to whatever.disabled when not in use (eMail 
  ralusp@mail.com if you're confused about this).
- added missing semicolon and quotes in embed instructions displayed after 
  create/edit polls.  (thx cyberdots)

[> 28-MARCH-2000 -- v0.1.3
* new format for the admin page
* much more simplification of the config file (this was my main objective).

[> 22-MARCH-2000 -- v0.1.2
- choices should now be displayed in the same order as entered.
- a few other minor bug fixes.
* some changes in the database tables format.  this SHOULD be the
  last change here for a while-- no need to worry about this happening
  every release. 
* cleaned up the config file a little.
* some code cleanup, html cleanup, and tweaks

[> 03-MARCH-2000 -- v0.1.1
- fixed bug that caused deleting a poll to occationally delete 
  choices from other polls.  in doing so, i also added a new field
  to the polllist table, and thus the old tables cannot be used.
  since i don't believe anybody except myself is using this at the
  moment, i don't see a need to include an upgrade script to preserve
  the table data.

[> 21-FEB-2000 -- v0.1.0 
* initial release.  includes functional voting booth, results 
  displayed as a vertical bargraph and as a count, a comprehensive
  list of togglable polls, and form-based poll administration.
